Readme document for the python bikeshare project.

In addition to the knowledge that I have gained from Udacity Python course through videos, talking to mentor, practice quiz, study materials and knowledge center, here are the list of my references that I used for the successful completion of project:

IntrotoPython.org - Accepting user input

Stackoverflow.org - for errors handling situations

Pandas.pydata.org - For the user of idxmax function and iloc method.
